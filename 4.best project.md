Answer:


This is my first job application, but Iâ€™ve been working on a few interesting projects at college. I consider this is one of my favourite project that deals with Design and Implementation of Online mobile shopping stock management system a DBMS project using Html,CSS, Javascript, Node, Express and MySql. I collaborated with one of my best friend and developed this project to manage the stock of mobiles and to monitor the quantity of mobiles of various brands. We designed this project to find and notify the Inventory Manager if the requested mobile has low quantity or out of stock. Hence I consider it one of my best projects. Having said that, I consider it only a start. I hope to work on many great projects in my new job, ideally with your company.
