This is my first job application, but Iâ€™ve been working on a few interesting projects at college . I consider the favourite one of mine is a project that deal with Design and Implementation of Online mobile shopping stock management system a DBMS project using Html,CSS, Javascript, Node, Express and MySql. I developed this project to manage the stock of mobiles and to monitor the quantity of mobiles of various brands and to find if the requested mobile has low quantity or out of stock . Hence I consider it one of my best projects. Having said that, I consider it only a start. I hope to work on many great projects in my new job, ideally with your company.
