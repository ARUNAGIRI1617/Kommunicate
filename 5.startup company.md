5.If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you will choose as your partner and why?

Answer:

I have an idea of building a SaaS(Software as a Service) based company offering services to users using the power of Open source Tools and NoCode Tech Stack. I would choose Mathesh and Elankavi as my partners in this dream journey.
In fact we all contributed in this idea of building SaaS based company. We always follow up with the growth of new technologies and discuss about gaining from it. We will always share our insights, knowledge and skills with each other and apart from that they are great friends who motivates to achieve goals in my life
and everybody need this kind of friends in their life and I am just happy because I got couple of them. With the knowledge and skills we acquired we believe that we have the potential to implement our plan and make them work in Real time and succeed.
